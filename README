Wordpress Single Page
v 0.0.1

Wordpress v 3.3.1
Brunch v 0.1.0

---------------------

Wordpress Single Page is a starting place for building single-page JavaScript applications on top of Wordpress via the Brunch Framework (Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, EcoTemplates) and Wordpress JSON api (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/)

About Brunch:
"A lightweight approach to building HTML5 applications with emphasis on elegance and simplicity."

http://brunch.io

About Wordpress JSON-API:
"JSON API allows you to retrieve and manipulate WordPress content using HTTP requests. There are three main goals:

- Provide a simple, consistent external interface
- Create a stable, understandable internal implementation
- Enable new types of extensions for WordPress

This plugin was created at The Museum of Modern Art for the weblog Inside/Out, which is served from Ruby on Rails. Instead of reimplementing the site templates as a WordPress theme, we opted for a Rails front-end that displays content served from a WordPress back-end. JSON API provides the necessary interface for retrieving content and accepting comment submissions."

Wordpress Setup

1.  Follow the standard Wordpress installation instructions at Wordpress.org:  http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress
2.  Once installed, navigate to the plugins page and enable JSON-API. 


Brunch Setup
1.  While the default brunch application has already been initialized in themes/blankslate/application, you'll still need to watch the directory for changes and output the files to the default theme directory.  cd into 'application' and execute

brunch watch --output ../ --server

This builds your project and outputs the .js files into themes/blankslate/scripts and css files into themes/blankslate/styles.
